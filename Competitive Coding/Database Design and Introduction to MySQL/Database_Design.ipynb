        "What are your three key takeaways from this session?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Entity Representation**: ERDs use entities to represent real-world objects, concepts, or things that have attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Entities are depicted as rectangles in the diagram and represent the tables in a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Relationship Modeling**: ERDs illustrate the relationships between entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Relationships represent how entities are connected or associated with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Common types of relationships include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.\n",
        "\n",
        "  These relationships are shown with lines connecting the related entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Attribute Specification**: ERDs include attributes, which describe the properties or characteristics of an entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Attributes are depicted as ovals or ellipses within the entity rectangles and provide details about the data that is stored for each entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Attributes can be simple (such as a single value) or composite (made up of multiple sub-attributes).\n",
        "\n",
        "  They help define the structure and content of the database tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, ERDs serve as a visual tool to design, analyze, and communicate the structure and relationships within a database system.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are essential for database developers, designers, and stakeholders to understand and document the database schema."
